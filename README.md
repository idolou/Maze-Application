Maze Appliction built with #EladShmulevich, using JAVA and Javafx. We used search algorithms, design patterns and client-server.

-To solve the maze we used searching algorithms such as: Breadth First Search, Best First Search , DFS - to create and solve the maze.

-To generate and solve the maze we used TCP Networking Simulation (on same pc) using LOCAL HOST , and PORT.

-Multi thread using for creation number of maze simultaneously, and solving them , using Pool Pattern.

-Design patterns such as : Bridge , Factory and Observer Design Patterns.

-The GUi is built on JAVAFX  including Design patterns such as Bridge , Factory and Observer.
-The user cab Zoom IN and OUT by CTRL+Mouse Scroll, move character with numpad/mouse, properties-configuration save,algrotihms selection for solving the maze.
